                        "When baby marmots are born, they have a dark brownish-black coat, but as they grow, their fur changes to a rusty brown during the summer and then back again when it's time for hibernation. These color changes in their fur make it simple to tell the different ages of marmots when you see them outside.",
                        "Marmots are like little digging machines! They have big teeth, sharp claws, and strong muscles in their shoulders and legs to help them dig. When they're all grown up, Vancouver Island marmots can be as long as 65 to 70 centimeters from their nose to the end of their fluffy tail. Female marmots usually weigh between 4.5 and 5.5 kilograms, while the boys can weigh up to 7.5 kilograms. During hibernation, both boys and girls lose a lot of weight—sometimes up to a third of their body mass! This means they can look quite different from when they first wake up in spring to when they're ready to sleep again in winter."

Through remarkable teamwork, efforts have been made to boost the wild population in recent years. In 2003, the marmot population hit a critical low with fewer than 30 individuals remaining in the wild. However, by 2021, this number had surged to over 200—a significant improvement.",
                        "These marmots reside in subalpine meadows where they graze on small plants during the spring and summer seasons. They have the unique ability to give birth to 1 to 6 pups every other year. What's truly remarkable is their hibernation period, which spans a whopping 7 months of the year. This makes them one of the few mammals that spend more time hibernating than they do awake. Presently, these marmots can be found inhabiting 20 to 30 mountain meadows on Vancouver Island."
